## Getting Started

If you've just installed this project, this should work:

```
jupyter-notebook
```

If you're in a new terminal from the one where you installed this project, you'll probably need to run this instead:

```
source ENV/bin/activate
jupyter-notebook
```

This should open up the Jupyter interface in your web browser. Click on "Lessons", and then "Chapter 1.ipynb" to start your magical learning adventure.
